69;1;1;If it was only about visual categorisation or sth similar, it'd be okay. If it's more elaborate, e.g., emotion transfer, then not - too personal;23;2;5;10;101
7;1;1;it would be fascinating to experience the effects. However I would not participate in research that is potentially harming me.;25;2;5;7;49
77;1;1;I would like to experience the world in the same way as another person does - everything is subjective and I believe that this would be a good way to better understand others. ;30;2;5;20;76
96;1;1;Because the possibilities fascinate me;25;2;35;60;49
66;1;1;For progress !!! ;);30;1;50;300;101
101;1;1;Depends on the technology.  I would not want anything with today's technology like plastic or metal or even that in neuromancer injected into my skull.   However, Microscopic organic smart cells that can be easily removed as well as implanted would be a possibility.  I would not be Patient Zero though.For the survey i answered Yes.;44;1;500;250;101
99;1;1;thats future of humnity. I'm neuroscientist so thats job and hobby to see experiments like this.;29;1;15;200;100
93;1;2;I would like to support developping new and helpful technologies and I would trust the researches that the experiments won't touch my private thoughts.;22;2;5;7;50
35;1;1;I'm fascinated by the idea of BtBI;24;2;5;10;73
96;1;1;because  i always been interested in research related to neuron & i always looking such opportunity. ;23;1;;;93
75;1;1;I am fascinated by it, and would like to contribute to researching and improving this technology.;24;2;20;25;78
61;2;1;Maybe only if I was paid.;26;2;30;50;55
